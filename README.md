# Deployment Link:
...

# Technologies Used:
Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

# Getting Started:
1) Navigate to the web app through the URL in the Deployment Link
2) Guests can view the most recent headlines on the main page.  They can chose to read the story by clicking on the headline, which will render the article show page.  They can also view a history of older articles in the archive section.
3) To create a new article simply sign in with Google OAuth and hit the Post Story link in the navigation banner.
4) To edit or delete an article, a user must have been the original author of the article.  They can edit with the controls on the main page or with the controls within the article show page.
5) On the article show page, any authenticated user can post a comment about the story.  Comments are embedded within the article document.
6) The original author also has an option to add to the story with the add story button.  This will render a page where the author can enter more article text.  When there is an update to the story, a timestamp will be provided along with the author and the new element to the story.  This will allow the reader to see updates as the story is developing.  These added stories are not embedded  within the main story, but rather reference it.
7) When an authenticated user is done with the site, they can logout.
8) Users can navigate through the web application at any point with the nav bar.

# Next Steps:
1) Consume a 3rd party API with baseball player data.  Link specific players in stories to their statistics pages.
2) Add full update and delete to comments.
3) Add full update and delete to story additions.
4) Add pictures into the articles.
5) Allow users to reply to specific comments.
